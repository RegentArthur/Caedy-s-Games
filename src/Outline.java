/*1. Project Setup
Initialize Project:

Create a new Java project.
Set up a version control system (Git) and create a repository on GitHub.
Define Project Structure:

Create packages for different components of the game:
src/
game/
game/entities/
game/gui/
game/utils/
test/
2. Requirements Analysis
Game Rules:

Define the basic rules of the game (e.g., Snake: the snake grows when it eats food; Tetris: pieces fall and fill rows).
Game Mechanics:

Movement controls (keyboard input for direction).
Game state management (start, pause, resume, game over).
Scoring system.
3. Design
UML Diagrams:
Create class diagrams for main classes (Game, Player, Board, Piece).
Create sequence diagrams for key interactions (e.g., piece movement, collision detection).
4. Implementation
Game Class:

Manage the game loop, state, and main game logic.
Methods: start(), pause(), resume(), gameOver(), update(), render().
Player Class:

Handle player-specific data and actions.
Methods: move(), updateScore().
Board Class:

Represent the game area.
Methods: initialize(), update(), render(), checkCollision().
Piece Class:

Represent game pieces (e.g., snake segments, Tetris shapes).
Methods: move(), rotate() (for Tetris), render().
Game Utilities:

Utility classes for handling input, timing, and random number generation.
Classes: InputHandler, Timer, RandomGenerator.
Graphical User Interface (GUI):

Use JavaFX or Swing for rendering the game.
Create a simple GUI for game controls and display (score, game state).
5. Testing and Debugging
Unit Testing:

Write unit tests for game mechanics using JUnit.
Test classes: GameTest, PlayerTest, BoardTest, PieceTest.
Integration Testing:

Test interactions between different components.
Ensure the game logic works as expected when components are integrated.
Debugging:

Implement logging for game events using java.util.logging.
Use breakpoints and debugging tools to identify and fix issues.
6. Deployment
Packaging:

Package the application as a runnable JAR file.
Create a README file with instructions for running the game.
Distribution:

Push the final project to the GitHub repository.
Optionally, create a release on GitHub for easy downloading.
7. Documentation
Code Documentation:

Add Javadoc comments to classes and methods.
Generate Javadoc documentation.
User Manual:

Write a user manual explaining how to play the game, controls, and game rules.
8. Bonus Features (Optional)
Enhanced Graphics:

Add more sophisticated graphics and animations.
Use sprite sheets for game pieces and backgrounds.
High Score Tracking:

Implement a high score tracking system with persistence (e.g., saving scores to a file or database).
Multiplayer Mode:

Add support for local multiplayer or networked multiplayer.
Sound Effects:

Incorporate sound effects and background music.*/
